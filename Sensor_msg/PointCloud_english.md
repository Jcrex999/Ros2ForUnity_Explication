# PointCloud.cs Functionality Overview

The `PointCloud` class is a C# wrapper for ROS (Robot Operating System) sensor_msgs/PointCloud message type. It provides functionality to interact with point cloud data in a ROS environment from C#.

## Core Components

### Properties
- `Header`: Contains metadata about the point cloud (timestamp, frame_id)
- `Points`: Array of `Point32` objects representing 3D points (x, y, z)
- `Channels`: Array of `ChannelFloat32` objects for additional data per point (intensity, RGB, etc.)

### Main Functions

1. **Constructor**: Creates a new empty point cloud with initialized arrays
   ```csharp
   var pointCloud = new PointCloud();
   ```

2. **ReadNativeMessage()**: Reads data from the native ROS message into the C# object
   ```csharp
   pointCloud.ReadNativeMessage();
   ```

3. **WriteNativeMessage()**: Writes data from the C# object to the native ROS message
   ```csharp
   pointCloud.WriteNativeMessage();
   ```

4. **Dispose()**: Frees native memory resources when done with the object
   ```csharp
   pointCloud.Dispose();
   ```

## When to Use

- **Data Transfer**: When you need to exchange point cloud data between ROS and your Unity application
- **Sensor Integration**: When working with 3D sensor data (LiDAR, depth cameras)
- **Visualization**: When you want to visualize point clouds in Unity
- **Processing**: When you need to perform operations on 3D point data

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Create a new point cloud
var cloud = new PointCloud();

// Set header information
cloud.Header.FrameId = "map";
cloud.Header.Stamp = new TimeStamp(Clock.Now());

// Add points
cloud.Points = new Point32[2];
cloud.Points[0] = new Point32 { X = 1.0f, Y = 2.0f, Z = 3.0f };
cloud.Points[1] = new Point32 { X = 4.0f, Y = 5.0f, Z = 6.0f };

// Add a channel (e.g., intensity)
cloud.Channels = new ChannelFloat32[1];
cloud.Channels[0] = new ChannelFloat32();
cloud.Channels[0].Name = "intensity";
cloud.Channels[0].Values = new float[] { 100.0f, 200.0f };

// Write to native message (when publishing)
cloud.WriteNativeMessage();

// Important: dispose when done
cloud.Dispose();
```

The class handles all native memory management through P/Invoke to interface with the underlying ROS C/C++ libraries.
